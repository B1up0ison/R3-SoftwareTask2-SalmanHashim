# R3-SoftwareTask2-SalmanHashim
**Summary**

This project works by having the client send specific data values "W, A, S, D" for KEYBOARD movement as well numbers ranging "0-5" to change the speed of the rover. This data is then sent, interpreted, and displayed by the server.

**Bugs**

During the development of this program, I had unfortunately not been able to run the client and server in tandem using a terminal because I had installed two separate versions of python and the pip for each python respectively had caused an error from it being run normally. This issue however can hypothetically be mitigated if one were to have one instance of python with pip installed in the correct directory.
